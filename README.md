PartyScout allows students and young adults isolated by COVID-19 to seamlessly connect together virtually through the medium of social gaming.

Our platform sorts users into parties based on their interests. To find a party, the user first selects their preferred party language, such as English, Spanish, Arabic, Chinese, Japanese, Korean, and Russian. They can then select specific games, game modes, and other criteria, which are sent to our servers when they click “Find your party.” After that, the user is placed in a queue to match with others based on their preferences. This match is often instant if there are enough people with similar interests in the queue. Finally, users can then contact their newfound parties to begin gaming and socializing with each other.
